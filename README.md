# MonkuGame

Hello everyone! Welcome to our repository for the final project in our Object-Oriented Programming course. In this project, we used Java and Java Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI).

## About This Project

MonkuGame is a simple game we developed as part of our final assignment. In this project, we focused on applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and using Java Swing to create an attractive and interactive user interface.
